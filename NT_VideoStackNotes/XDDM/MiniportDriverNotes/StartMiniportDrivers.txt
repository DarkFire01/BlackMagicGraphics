One of the first things done for the miniport driver occurs when the PnP manager requests the 
graphics adapter to me start, this occurs by calling 
HwVidFindAdapter
When you have a minimally setup miniport driver for your card, you're gonna assign a function to this calling
for example we will say FuncNameYouWant

VP_STATUS 
FuncNameYouWant_FindAdapter(PVOID HwDeviceExtension, 
                            PVOID HwContext, PWSTR ArgumentString, 
                            PVIDEO_PORT_CONFIG_INFO ConfigInfo, PUCHAR Again)
{
    /* here you'd put logic for your specfic card to indentify and start the card */
}
