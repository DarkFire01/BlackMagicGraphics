Oh boy OpenGL on windows is fun
OpenGL32 is a system file that manages the openGL ICD.
See in windows the OpenGL implementations is seperate from the rest of the
video stack. 
The OGL ICD is its own driver with its own.. basic functions you as a driver maker
supply for minimal setup. 

DrvCopyContext
DrvCreateContext
DrvCreateLayerContext
DrvDeleteContext
DrvDescribeLayerPlane
DrvDescribePixelFormat
DrvGetProcAddress
DrvGetLayerPaletteEntries
DrvRealizeLayerPalette
DrvReleaseContext
DrvSetCallbackProcs
DrvSetContext
DrvSetLayerPaletteEntries
DrvSetPixelFormatDrvShareLists
DrvSwapBuffers
DrvSwapLayerBuffers
DrvValidateVersion
LAYERPLANEDESCRIPTOR

The ICD isn't the only way to do this. But it is the most interesting, as its very isolated and allows
for some a very expansive driver and freedom
