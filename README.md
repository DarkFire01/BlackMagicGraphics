# BlackMagicGraphics
An open source playground for NT based graphics drivers

This repository is built to house a chunk of my notes and experiments done with graphics card and 3D/2D acceleration.
This is mostly targetting the NT 5.x style driver model (ReactOS, Windows XP), but I hope is helpful for anyone wanting to learn about physical graphics cards / hardware acceleration.
